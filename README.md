# TODO API with CRUD Operations

This project aims to explore different programming languages and frameworks by implementing a simple TODO API that supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Each folder within the project corresponds to a specific language and framework, and contains the implementation of the TODO API along with instructions for running and testing the code.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- Each folder is named after a programming language (e.g., `csharp`, `java`, `python`).
- Inside each language folder, you'll find:
  - The implementation of the TODO API.
  - A `README.md` file with specific instructions for how to set up, run, and test the code.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   You can fork and clone this repository to your local machine to explore different language implementations of the TODO API.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-api.git

2. **Navigate to a specific language folder**:

Once cloned, navigate to the folder for the programming language you want to explore. Each folder contains a README file with setup and run instructions.

3. **Run the code**:

Follow the specific instructions in the `README.md` inside the language folder to install dependencies, run the server, and test the API.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-name`).
5. Open a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.
